# Description 

Comet assay (also referred to as single-cell gel electrophoresis) is a commonly adopted technique to assess the extent of DNA damage at the level of individual cell with high sensitivity, high efficiency, and low cost. The DNA damage analysis can provide a lot of useful information regarding the diagnosis and progression of diseases, the value of different therapies, and the environmental and occupational exposure to harmful chemicals. DeepComet, which adopted a deep learning technique, is a tool for automatically quantifying DNA damage in each cell from comet assay image. DeepComet can segment each cell from comet assay image and classify them into either ghost cell or non-ghost cell, further it can quantify each segmented cell by comet parameters such as tail DNA percentage, tail moment, etc.
