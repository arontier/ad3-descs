# Description 

Epitope is a method for prediting T cell epitopes using Propred matrices while considering virus conservation.

# Inputs

The input file is a PDB file containing proteins in their monomeric form. 

# Outputs

1. 3D cartoon structures are color-coded based on epitope probability, ranging from blue (indicating low probability of epitopes) to red (indicating high probability of epitopes).
2. There are three rows of sequences. Fisrt is a query sequence (input sequence of 3D structure). Second is  an epitope sequences. Theird is conserved virus sequence.
