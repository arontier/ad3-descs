# Description 

Antibody-Antigen Interaction is developed by Arontier Co. for predicting the probability of interaction between antibodies and antigens. This model incorporates outputs from a protein language model and a transformer, which are then utilized in a convolutional neural network (CNN) module (ATI module) to calculate binding probabilities. It has been observed that this model outperforms the recent AbAgInterPre model, which is another antibody-antigen interaction prediction model.
