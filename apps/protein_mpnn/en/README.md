# Description 

PROTEIN SEQUENCE DESIGN is a method for reliably predicting protein sequences from structures using J. Dauparase et al. [1]. This method allows for the designation of specific residues for design.

# Inputs

1. Download a PDB file below for backbone-fixed sequence design.

- https://files.rcsb.org/download/4ZQK.pdb

2. Chain ID of proteins.

- Chain ID: A

3. Residue numbers indicating where mutation occurs. 

- 1-97

# Outputs

Sequences are generated based on input structures with variations in selected amino acids.
