# Description 

PROTEIN SEQUENCE DESIGN is a method for reliably predicting protein sequences from structures using J. Dauparase et al. [1]. This method allows for the designation of specific residues for design.

# Inputs

A PDB file containing protein structure information used for backbone-fixed sequence design.

# Outputs

Sequences are generated based on input structures with variations in selected amino acids.
