# Description 

PROTEIN SEQUENCE DESIGN is a method for reliably predicting protein sequences from structures using J. Dauparase et al. [1]. This method allows for the designation of specific residues for design.

# Inputs

Describe the inputs and link sample input files.

# Outputs

Outputs are sequences ge
